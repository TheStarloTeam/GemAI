# SPACEAI VISION ML MODEL

SpaceAI will soon have some key features and functions for Vision, Image classifications and detection. We're currently making an "NSFW or SFW" detector using PyTorch models like [ResNet50](https://medium.com/@nitishkundu1993/exploring-resnet50-an-in-depth-look-at-the-model-architecture-and-code-implementation-d8d8fa67e46f#:~:text=ResNet50%20is%20a%20deep%20convolutional,which%20is%2050%20layers%20deep.) for better Vision controls.
